# Bike-Share Analysis

### Project Overview

I am a data analyst tasked with performing a detailed analysis of the data of this bike-share company. I have studied the bike-share data and I am confident these actionable insights will help the company achieve its goal of strategic decision-making.

### Data Sources

The data was located in the companyâ€™s database and stored as a CSV file. This data is primary data collected by the company itself. This makes it highly reliable for this purpose.

### Data Processing

The CSV data was extracted and converted into .xlsx format. Microsoft Excel was used for data preparation, exploration and visualization. I chose this tool because of its versatility and data organization functions which makes insight generation easier.
I cleaned the data and prepared it for analysis.
Analysis was done using different Excel functions and the pivot table.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the historical bike trip data to answer questions such as;

- What are the types of customers the company has and what is the count for each
- Do men make use of the service than women?
- What age group makes use of the bikeshare service the most?
- What is the average trip duration?
- What is the age distribution of customers?
- What is the most common start station?
